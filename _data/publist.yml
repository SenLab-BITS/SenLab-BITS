- title: "The case for smartwatch-based diet monitoring"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: We explore the use of gesture recognition on a wrist-worn smartwatch as an enabler of an automated eating activity (and diet monitoring) system. We show, using small-scale user studies, how it is possible to use the accelerometer and gyroscope data from a smartwatch to accurately separate eating episodes from similar non-eating activities, and to additionally identify the mode of eating (i.e., using a spoon, bare hands or chopsticks).
